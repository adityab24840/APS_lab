Problem: 
     Consider the following model for a bus-ridership analysis:
    1. at each stop, each passenger is likely to get off the bus independent
of others with a 20% chance;
    2. at every stop, there is a 50%/40%/10% chance of 0/1/2 passengers
getting on board;
    3. the bus never gets full; new passengers at any stop can always be
accommodated;
    4. bus is empty when it arrives at the first stop.

Write an R code to calculate using simulation the probability that the
bus is empty after visiting the tenth stop.
