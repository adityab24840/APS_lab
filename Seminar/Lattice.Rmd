```{r}
library(lattice)
x <- 1:10
y <- x^2
xyplot(y ~ x, type = "l")

Level Plot
A level plot is a type of lattice graph that is used to display the values of a function of two variables over a rectangular region.

```{r}
library(lattice)
x <- seq(-pi, pi, length.out = 100)
y <- seq(-pi, pi, length.out = 100)
z <- outer(x, y, function(x, y) sin(sqrt(x^2 + y^2)))
levelplot(z, xlab = "x", ylab = "y",
		main = "2D Sin Function")

```
Dendrogram
A dendrogram is a type of lattice graph that shows the hierarchical structure of a dataset. It is used to represent the results of hierarchical clustering or other forms of data grouping.

```{r}
library(stats)
data(mtcars)

d <- dist(mtcars[, 1:4])
fit <- hclust(d)
plot(fit)

```
